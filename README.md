 # Real Estate House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Real Estate House Price Prediction using Machine Learning** project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a machine-learning model that predicts house prices based on various features of real estate properties.
This machine learning model predicts the price of a real state house based on different properties of the house such as the number of bedrooms, area of the house, and so on. This machine-learning model uses Linear regression.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a machine-learning model that can accurately predict house prices, allowing potential buyers and sellers to make more informed decisions. By analyzing a set of features that describe a property, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and more, the model will learn patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains a collection of real estate listings with various attributes. It includes both numerical and categorical features, such as square footage, neighborhood, number of bedrooms, and more. The dataset has been preprocessed to handle missing values and categorical variables, making it ready for training the model.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/krissh6563-droid/real-estate-house-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd real-estate-house-price-prediction
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) using:
   ```
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. After installation, you can run the project using:
   ```
   python models.ipynb
   ```

2. This will prompt you to enter the property details such as size, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, etc.

3. The trained model will then predict the price of the property based on the provided details.

## Model

We are using a machine learning model based on [Random Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest) algorithm for this project. The model has been trained on the provided dataset to learn the relationships between the features and house prices.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into how well the model's predictions align with the actual house prices.
